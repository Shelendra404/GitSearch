## Project info

After learning some basic JavaScript and turning my attention into React, I decided to redo my old GitSearch-project. The old version was made with php for a WordPress-page, the new one utilizes ReactJS. This is a work in progress, and the first project I have made with React, ever (following along tutorials doesn't really count).

### Implementation

There is currently no implementation of this code for testing purposes. I might eventually add this on my website.

### To-do

- Some blocks of code have already been turned into their own components. Check out if more clean-up can be done
- Add some proper styling to the components
- Add functionality: links to repositories, last commits, name, avatar, date and message of commit
- Possibly implement this to my web site for public testing
