## Project info

After learning some basic JavaScript and turning my attention into React, I decided to redo my old GitSearch-project. The old version was made with php for a WordPress-page, the new one utilizes ReactJS. This is a work in progress, and the first project I have made with React, ever (following along tutorials doesn't really count).

### implementation

There is currently no implementation of this code for testing purposes. I might eventually add this on my website.
